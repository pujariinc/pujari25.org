                              <p align="justify"> Pujari has been successfully and   enthusiastically quenching the cultural thirst of the Atlanta Bengali   community for more than a decade. Started by a group of highly energetic   and passionate volunteers living in and around Atlanta, Pujari began as   a convention to celebrate the culture and rich heritage of India to   fulfill the nostalgic affinity.</p>
                              <p align="justify">&nbsp; </p>
                              <p align="justify"> A nonprofit, nonpolitical, socio-cultural organization, Pujari of   Atlanta was formed to foster friendship and understanding between the   people of Bengali origin, Indian origin, and the Americans in 1986 and   was finally incorporated as a nonprofit tax-exempt organization since   2001. From the very inception, the organization has enjoyed absolute   loyalty and patronage of most of the Bengali families in metropolitan   Atlanta and its neighboring states like Tennessee, Florida, Alabama,   North Carolina, South Carolina, and Arkansas. It conducts, coordinates,   and promotes the community, cultural and socio-religious activities   among the people of Indian origin in the USA and the people of other   cultures on behalf of the Bengali community.</p>
                              <p align="justify">&nbsp; </p>
                              <p align="justify"> Pujari entered into an unprecedented growth path ever since the   induction of a large population of young volunteers into the   organization. Due to overwhelming support and cooperation from the   community youth, Pujari has been organizing several popular activities   like Annual Picnic, Tennis Tournament, and News Year's Eve Celebrations   every year.<br />
                                  <br />
                                After Incorporation, Pujari started working on charitable causes more   than ever before. After September 11, 2001 WTC tragedy, it co-hosted a   charity event with SEBA (South Eastern Bengali Association) to raise   money for Red Cross. It raised and donated more than thousands dollar   for 2004 Tsunami relief, along with Robin Raina foundation. Pujari and   its members regularly donate to several charitable causes such as   literacy mission and early childhood education for the underprivileged.<br />
  <br />
                                Pujari's printed bi-lingual publication was invigorated and renamed   'Anjali' in 2003&nbsp; - which is counted as one of the top publications   among the Atlanta Bengali community. The Sharodiya Anjali is being   contributed by several well-known writers from India and abroad.<br />
  <br />
                                Membership continued to grow every year and with larger demand for   capacity and better facilities, Pujari managed to switch to a larger   location to host its events with ample of parking, fully equipped   auditorium and cafeteria at Berkmar High School at Gwinnett Country.   Pujari has been hosting famous Bengali artists from Indian sub-continent   like Saikat Mitra, Nachiketa, Tanushree Shankar, Band Kaya etc. and   continues to enjoy the privilege of being counted as a pioneer Bengali   organization in the US.</p>
